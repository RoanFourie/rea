# A Simple Real Estate Tutorial by Lars Gebhardt
## Done to learn Ruby on Rails
[http://larsgebhardt.de/build-your-own-real-estate-listing-service-with-ruby-on-rails-and-sphinx-part-1/](Build Your Own Real Estate Listing Service with Ruby on Rails and Sphinx Part 1)
I ommitted the Sphinx and the Test portions of the tutorial.
The tutorial is outdated, I used a newer version of Ruby
* Ruby 2.2.0
* Rails 5.0.0
